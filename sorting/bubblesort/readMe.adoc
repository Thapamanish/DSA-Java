= Bubble Sort
The simplest sorting algorithm.

== Idea
* Repeatedly compare adjacent elements, and swap if they’re in the wrong order.
* After the 1st pass, the largest element “bubbles” to the end.
* Repeat until the array is sorted.

== Pseudocode
[source,pseudocode]
----
for i = 0 to n-1:
    for j = 0 to n-i-2:
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])

== Complexity
* *Worst Case Time:* `O(n^2^)`
* *Best Case Time (Optimized):* `O(n)`
* *Space:* `O(1)` (in-place)
