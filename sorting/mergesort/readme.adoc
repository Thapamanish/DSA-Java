= Merge Sort — Story, Intuition, and Notes

== 🪢 Story / Analogy
Imagine sorting a deck of cards by splitting it into two piles.
You sort each pile individually, then merge them together by
always picking the smallest top card. This is Merge Sort.

== 🔍 Algorithm (Ascending)
. Divide the array into two halves.
. Recursively sort each half.
. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

== ⏱️ Complexity
* Time: O(N log N) in best, average, and worst cases.
* Space: O(N) for temporary arrays used during merging.
* Stability: Stable (equal elements keep their relative order).

== ✅ When to Use
* When you need guaranteed O(N log N).
* Works well for linked lists and external sorting (large files).

== 🧠 Correctness Sketch
* Base case: arrays of size 1 are trivially sorted.
* Recursive step: if both halves are sorted, merging produces a sorted whole.
* By induction, the full array is sorted.

== 🧪 Dry Run
Array: [4, 1, 3, 2]

* Split → [4,1], [3,2]
* Sort left → [1,4]
* Sort right → [2,3]
* Merge → [1,2,3,4]
