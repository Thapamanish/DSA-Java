= Sorting Algorithms Roadmap

We'll learn them in progressive order:

* *Elementary sorts* (`O(n^2^)`) - easy to understand, good for learning basics:
** Bubble Sort
** Selection Sort
** Insertion Sort

* *Efficient sorts* (`O(n log n)`) - real-world use:
** Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer, stable)
** Quick Sort (Divide & Conquer, in-place)
** Heap Sort (based on PriorityQueue / heaps)

* *Specialized sorts* - later:
** Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort (for specific cases)
