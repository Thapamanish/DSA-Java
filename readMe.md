## DSA in Java: A Structured Question Bank (Beginner to Advanced)

This repository serves as a structured guide and question bank for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It's designed for learners at all levels, from those just starting out to those preparing for complex technical interviews.

The philosophy is simple: **master the fundamentals, then build on them.** Problems are categorized not only by topic but also by difficulty to provide a clear learning path.

### How This Repository is Organized

The problems are structured to help you build a strong foundation and progressively tackle more complex challenges.

* **ðŸ”° Beginner:** These problems focus on the core mechanics of a data structure or a basic algorithm. The goal is to solidify your understanding of how things work. *(e.g., "Find the maximum element in an array," "Reverse a Linked List").*

* **ðŸ”· Intermediate:** These questions often require using a data structure to solve a problem or involve common patterns like the Two-Pointers or Sliding Window techniques. *(e.g., "Find the first non-repeating character in a string," "Validate a Binary Search Tree").*

* **ðŸ”¥ Advanced:** These problems test deeper understanding and often involve complex logic, optimizations, or combining multiple concepts. This is where you'll find problems related to Dynamic Programming, complex Graph traversals, and more. *(e.g., "Word Ladder," "Median of Two Sorted Arrays").*

### How to Use This Repo

1.  **Pick a Topic:** Start with a data structure or algorithm you want to learn (e.g., Arrays, Recursion).
2.  **Start with Beginner:** Solve the beginner-level problems first. Make sure you understand the "why" behind the solution, not just the code.
3.  **Work Your Way Up:** Once you feel confident, move on to the intermediate and then advanced problems in that topic.

This structured approach is designed to turn memorized concepts into true, intuitive problem-solving skills. Contributions are welcome!
